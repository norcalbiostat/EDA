Summary paragraph: The purpose of our research is to examine how steroids affected baseball during the steroid era. More specifically, we want to see if hitters did not actually gain an advantage by being on steroids because the pitchers were also on steroids. We will do this by comparing the On Base Plus Slugging (OPS) of the hitters with the ERA of the pitchers. The OPS is the sum of a statistic of how often a hitter reaches base and a statistic that measures the batting productivity of a hitter. The ERA is the mean of the earned runs given up by a pitcher. By looking at these statistics for players before and after the steroid era, we can see wether hitters did not acutally gain an advantage.
