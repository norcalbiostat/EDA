This site is an exploratory data analysis of baseball data. 

Data used in this analysis can be found at [Lahman's Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) 



On this project site we investigate the following question:

 During the steroid era of baseball (roughly 1988-2003), we want to see if hitters did not actually gain an advantage by being on steroids because the pitchers were also on steroids. We will do this by comparing the on-base plus sluging (OPS) of the hitters with the earned run averge (ERA) of the pitchers. The OPS is the sum of a statistic of how often a hitter reaches base and a statistic that measures the batting productivity of a hitter. The ERA is the mean of the earned runs given up by a pitcher. By looking at these statistics for players before and after the steroid era, we can see whether hitters did not actually gain an advantage. 
 
It is important to note that:

__The lower the ERA, the better the pitcher is considered.__ 

__The higher the OPS, the better the batter is considered.__
