```{r}
batting2 = filter(batting, batting$yearID > 1961) %>% select(yearID,H,X2B,X3B,HR,AB,BB,HBP,SF) %>% na.omit() %>% mutate(TB = H+2*X2B+(3*X3B)+(4*HR)) %>% mutate(SLG = TB/AB) %>% na.omit() %>% mutate(OBP = (H + BB + HBP)/(AB + BB + SF + HBP)) %>% mutate(OPS = SLG + OBP) %>% 
  mutate(steroidEra = (yearID>1983 & yearID<2003))

table = batting2 %>% group_by(yearID,steroidEra) %>% summarise(avgOPS = mean(OPS))

ggplot(table, aes(x =yearID, y = avgOPS)) + geom_point(aes(x =yearID, y = avgOPS ,col=steroidEra)) + geom_smooth(se=FALSE) + ggtitle("Average OPS Over Time") + xlab("Year") + ylab("Average OPS")
```

### We can see that average OPS increases steadily during the 60's and 70's, increasing moderately still through 80's, plateu around 2000,  then decreases steadily after.

```{r}
pitching2 = filter(pitching, pitching$yearID > 1961)%>%
  select(yearID,ERA) %>% na.omit %>%
  mutate(steroidEra = (yearID>1983 & yearID<2003))
table2 = pitching2 %>% group_by(yearID,steroidEra) %>% summarise(avgERA = mean(ERA))
ggplot(table2, aes(x =yearID, y = avgERA)) + geom_point(aes(col = steroidEra)) + geom_smooth(se=FALSE) + ggtitle("Average ERA Over Time") + xlab("Year") + ylab("Average ERA")  + labs(fill = "Steroid Era")

```

###We can see that average ERA decreases until the 1980's, then increases drasticly up till the early 2000's, then begins a steady decrease.

----

*__From the 60's up till the steriod era, we see an increase in average OPS and decrease in average ERA, signifying that preformance was increasing for both pitchers and hitters.__* 


*__During the steriod era, ERA increase when OPS did, and then both begin to decrease around the end of the steriod era.__*

*__It appears that steriods did give an advantage to batters over pithers during the steriod era.__*

```{r}
batsal = left_join(batting,salaries, by="playerID")
batsal2 = filter(batsal, batsal$yearID.x > 1985) %>% select(yearID.x,H,X2B,X3B,HR,AB,BB,HBP,SF,salary,teamID.x) %>% na.omit() %>% mutate(TB = H+2*X2B+(3*X3B)+(4*HR)) %>% mutate(SLG = TB/AB) %>% na.omit() %>% mutate(OBP = (H + BB + HBP)/(AB + BB + SF + HBP)) %>% mutate(OPS = SLG + OBP)

table4 = batsal2 %>% group_by(yearID.x) %>% summarise(avgOPS = mean(OPS), meansalprop=mean(salary)/10000000)


ggplot() + geom_smooth(data=table4, aes(x=yearID.x,y=avgOPS),se=FALSE) + geom_smooth(data=table4, aes(x=yearID.x,y=meansalprop),se=FALSE) + xlab("Year") + ylab("AverageOPS, Salary")

```

###The bottom line shows that salaries were increasing quicker when OPS was increasing.

#Things to consider for for RQ's: strikeouts and era for pitchers pre, during and post(steriod use).....also obp and batting average for hitters pre, during and post.
#Steriod use staring around late 80's and dying out in 2003, yet continuing to see suspensions to this day for steriods.
